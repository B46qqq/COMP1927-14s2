(a) (6 marks)
(i) show the adjacency matrix for the graph

(ii) show the adjacency list for the graph

(iii) assume the adjacency list has the following struct for vertices:
struct adjListNode {
    int to;
    int weight;
    struct adjListNode *next;
};

How much space does the two data structures occupy?
