The exam is split in two parts:

q1-q3: practical component (45 marks)
open folders (using cd) for q1, q2, q3
each question is worth 15 marks

q4-q8: theory component (45 marks)
open qX.txt for the question, and answer there
q4: 2 marks
q5: 10 marks
q6: 8 marks
q7: 8 marks
q8: 17 marks

The exam is probably a little longer than the real exam ;)
Good luck!
